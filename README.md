# Bike_Sales_Project-Excel-

**Scope of Work (SOWs):**
•	Find out the correlation of different columns with the number of bike sales.
•	Create Pivot Tables. 
•	Generate a Chart from the Pivot Table data. 
•	Create a Dashboard and add filters.
Initially, I copied the whole dataset from another worksheet and created a column to divide the age column among different ranges (Young<30, 31<=Middle Aged<=55, Old>55). Then, I started to work on data to generate Pivot Table in another worksheet. 
**Dataset**
The dataset is a representation of bike sale data from three different regions (Europe, Pacific, and North America), where 13 columns (ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike) contains data of 1026 participants. 

Another worksheet has been created for the Pivot Table. Five different pivot tables are generated along with charts. The first pivot table illustrates the number of people who purchased a bike or did not, according to their age groups (Young, Middle Aged, Old). The percentage of the population is represented by a stacked Column chart. As the population of age groups are not same, the staged column chart represented the data in less biased way.

The second pivot table is generated because the difference in customer commuter distance plays an important role in vehicle purchasing. A line graph represents the changes in the number of bikes purchased with increasing commuter distance.

The average income of different gender does not illustrate any significant difference. This pivot table is represented by a column chart.

Furthermore, the last two pivot tables point out that there are no significant differences in between the genders of bike purchase data over the age brackets.

**Filters**
Four distinct filters are applied the on the dashboard, as the data are varied with different options of them. These Filters are Region, Occupation, Education, Home Owner.
